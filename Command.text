#Installing pyautogui and pyserial modules for windows: 

STEP 1: Open Windows Command prompt and change the directory to the folder 
where you have installed python. By default the command should be  
cd C:\Python27 

STEP 2: Inside your python directory use the command “python –m pip install 
upgrade pip” to upgrade your pip. Pip is a tool in python which helps us to 
install python modules easily. Once this module is upgraded proceed to next step.  
python –m pip install –-upgrade pip 

STEP 3: Use the command “python –m pip install pyautogui” to install the 
pyautogui module.  
python –m pip install pyautogui 

NOTE – Repeat the same process to install pyserial, replace pyautogui by pyserial 
in this process.
